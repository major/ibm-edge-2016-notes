Trends and Directions -- IBM Power Systems
==========================================

*Speaker: Doug Balog*

* Development focused on real-time analytics of large streams of data
* 78% of cloud initiatives are coordinated or fully integrated

  * They have a plan for cloud in place or are using it already
  * It's all about business outcomes anyway

* Need to make it easier for customers to consume the offering

  * Servers are getting more complex, but we need to do more with less
  * Cloud is now a business conversation and less of a technology conversation

* New cloud models announced today for high-end use

  * C-model range makes it easier to use POWER in clouds
  * Reduces operating costs up to 50%
  * Designed specifically for IBM AIX clients who want an on-premises cloud

* OpenStack is used to bridge the gap between private and public clouds

*Guests on stage from Bosch and Staples*

* Staples hybrid strategy

  * Faster deployments and easier scaling on cloud
  * Clouds need to connect to the backend systems of record
  * Built out their own IaaS so developers could deploy their applications and
    iterate faster
  * Developers can deploy code with a button push

* Bosch story

  * Need high availability/stability
  * Using in-memory databases
  * Why POWER for SAP HANA?

    * Better reliability/stability for enterprise IT
    * Need a flexible platform to allow business to react faster
    * TCO was a serious concern -- POWER had a lower TCO than alternatives

  * Journey to HANA -- advice for others?

    * Think about bigger databases
    * Think about how you can react faster for customers
    * Forget about spending time reconfiguring hardware

* 300 clients in the transition to HANA on POWER now

* OpenPOWER

  * Five founding members started with an idea and had a shared vision
  * OpenPOWER foundation has 250+ members today
  * First system

    * IBM has released new OpenPOWER based servers with help from NVIDIA
    * First system: POWER 8 processor has 5x faster GPU throughput than Intel with new
      nv-link functionality

  * Second system

    * 96TB storage available

  * Third system (S812LC 1U)

    * High density, high capacity compute
    * Web servers, data analytics, etc

* RapidBuild Program

  * Rapidly deploy mission critical applications
  * Using OpenStack for management and provisioning
  * Get database as a service in an integrated solution

* POWER in the public cloud

  * Softlayer, Tencent, Rackspace, and Google
  * FREEPOWER8 (free code to use POWER at SoftLayer today)
  * Rackspace

    * Member of the OpenPOWER foundation, focused on OpenCompute
    * Worked with the OpenCompute community to make a POWER8-based server
    * Barreleye available to purchase today!

  * Google

    * Bringing POWER9 to OpenCompute

* Days of Moore's law has come to an end

  * Can't just shrink transistors over and over again
  * Can't keeping making them more dense on the chip
  * Performance must come from new areas
  * Requires bringing multiple companies together to innovate on performance
  * 2,500 Linux ISV's developing on POWER
  * 100K open source packages

* New announcements

  * Red Hat - lots of kernel development and improvements to take advantage of
    new hardware capabilities
  * Canonical - Released on LinuxONE, Z, Intel, POWER at the same time
  * NGINX - optimizing web servers for POWER
  * Mirantis

*Greg from Mirantis on stage*

* Mirantis/IBM working on an architecture to bring POWER 8 compute nodes into
  private clouds

*Jeff Stuecheli from IBM on stage to talk architecture*

* Yesterday's datacenter designs

  * High performance POWER mission critical stuff
  * Sprawl of under-utilized servers
  * Made clouds of commodity servers
  * Public clouds made of mostly commodity infrastructure (driven by
    faster/cheaper servers)
  * More reliance on software to drive performance, not hardware

    * Leads to Moore's Law problems
    * Software scaling issues

* Disruptive forces

  * POWER8 is 14nm, but 7nm is possible
  * Intel says 4nm is exotic technology

* We used to have faster processors consuming less power each time
* Costs more and more money to get smaller and smaller (billions of dollars to
  build a new fab)
* Cross-correlation of data drives the need for faster processors
* Programmatic vs Cognitive

  * Programmatic -- you tell the computer what to do
  * Cognitive -- you teach the computer rather than programming it

* Workload optimized systems help us survive the end of Moore's Law
